        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ol>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Passing cars,
        <br> When you can't see,
        <br> May get you,
        <br> A glimpse,
        <br> Of eternity.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cell phone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with on Segway.</q>
